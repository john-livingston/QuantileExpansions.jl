# API reference

Hand-maintained (Julia package; no autodoc). All functions are allocation-free
scalar kernels unless noted; batch functions require a preallocated `out`.

## Black–Scholes implied volatility

Inputs: log-moneyness `k = log(K/F)`, normalized undiscounted forward call
price `c`. Output: total volatility `v = σ√T`.

### `bs_implied_vol(k, c; tol=1e-14, maxiter=8) -> v`
Adaptive solver, residual test after each update: ~1.6e-15 dense worst-case.
NaN inputs propagate to NaN.

### `bs_implied_vol_generic(k, c; tol=1e-14) -> v`
Adaptive solver through the generic interface, residual test before each
update — one step faster, ~8.9e-14 dense worst-case.

### `bs_implied_vol_cert(k, c; tol=1e-14) -> v`
Certified variant: skips the confirmation evaluation when the K4 error model
proves the first update sufficient. Identical results; near-neutral speed on
typical grids.

### `bs_implied_vol_fixed(k, c, Val(N)=Val(3)) -> v`
Branch-free, exactly `N` HH-4 updates, **no convergence test**. Valid for
delta ∈ [0.05, 0.95], vol ∈ [0.01, 2.0]: `Val(3)` → ~1.6e-15, `Val(2)` →
~4.7e-11 there. Outside that band errors grow with no signal — use the adaptive
solvers. Results clamp to v ∈ [1e-10, 5].

### `bs_implied_vol_fixed_batch!(out, ks, cs, Val(N), Val(W); vector_seed, ws)`
SIMD batch (`W` lanes; 8 recommended). `vector_seed=true` (x86 default) runs
the fully-fused branch-free path; `false` (ARM default) a scalar-seed two-pass
path — pass `ws=BSFixedWorkspace(n)` to make repeat two-pass calls
allocation-free.

### `bs_implied_vol_fixed_batch_threaded!(out, ks, cs, Val(N), Val(W); ...)`
The batch kernel across all Julia threads (contiguous chunks). Bit-for-bit
identical to the serial batch.

### `bs_implied_vol_grad(k, c; tol=1e-14) -> (v, ∂v/∂c, ∂v/∂k)`
Implied vol plus exact first-order sensitivities via the implicit function
theorem.

### `bs_price(κ, v) -> c`
Forward map: normalized OTM call price at `κ = |k|`.

## Inverse Gaussian

### `ig_quantile(μ, λ, p; tol=1e-13) -> x`
Scalar IG quantile; forward residual ~1e-13.

### `ig_quantile_cert(μ, λ, p; tol=1e-13) -> x`
Certified variant (fires only in the near-Gaussian λ/μ ≳ 100 regime;
otherwise equivalent).

### `ig_quantile_batch!(out, μ, λ, ps, Val(N), Val(W))`
Fixed-shape SIMD batch; `Val(3)` reaches machine forward residual.

### `ig_quantile_batch_threaded!(out, μ, λ, ps, Val(N), Val(W))`
Threads × SIMD variant; bit-for-bit identical to serial.

## Gamma

Scale-1 quantiles; multiply by θ for `Gamma(a, θ)`.

### `gamma_quantile_log(a, u; tol=1e-14) -> x`
**Recommended.** Log-space solver (port of Hekimoglu's engine): series /
Cornish–Fisher / Mills seeds, density-scaled stopping, ~1e-10 log-accuracy
into the deep tails. Exact closed forms at `a=1`, `a=½`.

### `gamma_quantile_log_cert(a, u; tol=1e-14) -> x`
Certified variant — 1.43× faster in the central region at identical results.

### `gamma_quantile_batch!(out, a, us; tol=1e-14, certified=true)`
Fixed-shape batch with the per-shape constructor work amortized.

### `gamma_quantile(a, p; tol=1e-13) -> x`
x-space baseline (Wilson–Hilferty seed). Kept for comparison; tails degrade
to ~1e-7 log-accuracy at large `a`.

## Beta

### `beta_quantile_logit(a, b, p; tol=1e-14) -> x`
**Recommended.** Logit-space solver (Hekimoglu's coordinate change + exact
endpoint branches over this package's regime seeds, CF5 central seed):
~2e-14 uniformly. Exact closed forms at `b=1`, `a=1`, `(½,½)`.

### `beta_quantile_logit_cert(a, b, p; tol=1e-14) -> x`
Certified variant.

### `beta_quantile_batch!(out, a, b, ps; tol=1e-14, certified=true)`
Fixed-shape batch; logbeta and CF5 cumulants computed once per (a,b).

### `beta_quantile(a, b, p; tol=1e-13) -> x`
x-space baseline; loses accuracy near endpoints for skewed shapes.

## Generic interface

### `QuantileProblem`
Abstract supertype. Implement `seed(D, p)` and
`hh_terms(D, x, p) -> (f, f′, f″/f′, f‴/f′)`; optionally `xlo`/`xhi` bounds,
`converged(D, f, fp, tol)` (density-scaled stopping), and
`hh4_c4(D, x) = f⁗/f′` + `has_c4` to enable certification.

### `solve(D, p; tol=1e-14, maxiter=8) -> x`
The universal safeguarded HH-4 loop (Newton and damped-bracket fallbacks).

### `solve_certified(D, p; tol=1e-14, τ=1e-14, safety=16.0, maxiter=8) -> x`
As `solve`, but exits without a confirmation evaluation when
`safety·K4·r⁴ ≤ τ` at the seed.

## Special functions (exported utilities)

`normcdf`, `normpdf`, `norminv` (Acklam, guarded), `normcdf_pdf` (Φ and φ from
one exp), `erfc_hi`, `erfcx_pos`, and the branch-free SIMD-generic variants
`vexp`, `vlog`.
